 * Vertical Formatting
 * 
 * The code should be redable from top to bottom without many jumps or horizantal scrolling.
 * Obusly, this is hard to react in larger codebases, there always be calls to function, imports, etc
 * but, a good way is to keep the code as vertical as possible, this means:
 * - Avoiding long lines of code
 * - Avoiding horizontal scrolling
 * - Avoiding too many nested blocks of code
 * - Avoiding too many imports and exports in the same file
 * - Avoiding too many comments in the same file
 * - Avoiding too many functions in the same file
 * - Avoiding too many classes in the same file
 * - Avoiding too many variables in the same file
 * - Avoiding too many constants in the same file
 * - Avoiding too many types in the same file
 * - Avoiding too many interfaces in the same file
 * - Avoiding too many enums in the same file
 * - Avoiding too many generics in the same file
 * - Avoiding too many decorators in the same file
 * - Avoiding too many comments in the same file
 * 
 * Ex:
