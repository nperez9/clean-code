# Clean code & Snippets Repostory

## Snippets:

A bunch of snippers that i found usefull in the lenguages I usually work on, mostly TS utils functions and Godot Shaders or utilities for my games 

# Clean Code 

Is code that you can be readed by any developer that works in your proyects, or even yourself in a future not so distant. There is a major diferrence between the code that works and the one you can use to build a larger, sustainable and maintenable proyect.

This guide will apply to all paradigm of code: Functional, OOP and procedural.

Most important, build quiality code is not always clear at frist, to get this concepts is important to refactor a lot! Refactor the code today can save you tomorrow.

## Our code should:

- Should be readable and meaningful
- Should reduce cognitive load to be understanding
- Should be concise and go "to the point"
- Should be easy to write and to maintain
- Should follow the common best practices and patterns
- Should avoid unintitive names, complex nesting and big code blocks

Remember, you are the author of your code! Try to keep it to your reputation

## Key pain points:

- Naming
- Structure and comments
- Functions: Length and Paramaters
- Conditionals and Error handling
- Classes and Data sctructures
- Common programming principles


## Naming:

- Names should be meaningful -> meaningfulNames.ts
- Things should be correctly named based on the functionality (ex: variables, functions, classes) -> correctlyNaming.ts
- Should follow the naming conventions of the project/language -> nameConventions.ts
- Data containers (variables, constants, properties) has to be named depending in the data that this ones contains and represents -> dataContainersNames.ts
- Functions & methods names should describe an operation, getters and setters can avoid this rule -> functionsNames.ts
- Classes should be named based on objects and entities that represents -> classesNames.ts

You can check the documentation of these examples with the Naming things.pdf

## Structure, format & comments:
- Bad
